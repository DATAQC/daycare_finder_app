<strong>Little Turtles Childcare Finder</strong>For my Hackbright project I wrote a childcare finder app. I wanted to build this app to address some of the issues I encountered when searching for a daycare for my daughter. The main challenge being that there isnâ€™t a centralized searchable database for daycares in the East Bay. The core of the site is its search functionality. A parent can search by location or a number of additional criteria. The app includes a worksheet page for parents to allow them to make notes about daycares that interest them. The app is built with Python and a Flask framework. I used SQLite and SQLAlchemy to create a database with 8 tables. Relationships are key to my data so I selected these technologies to create a relational database. I used a Jquery library called Jeditable to enable the user to make edits to either their worksheet (parents), or their profile page (daycare owners). This feature also required AJAX and Javascript to complete the functionality. <strong>Technology Stack:</strong>Python, Flask, SQLite3, SQLAlchemy, Jinja, Javascript, Jquery, Ajax, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap
