#<strong>Little Turtles Childcare Finder</strong>For my Hackbright project I built a daycare finder app to help parents research and choose daycares that meet their individual needs. The site features advanced search functionality and a secure parent profile page, as well as a worksheet to help parents record and track their findings. Daycare owners can create and manage their business profile. The app is built with Python and a Flask framework. I used SQLite and SQLAlchemy to create a database with 8 tables. Relationships are key to my data so I selected these technologies to create a relational database. I used a Jquery library called Jeditable to enable the user to make in-place edits to either their worksheet (parents), or their profile page (daycare owners). This feature also required AJAX and Javascript to complete the functionality. <strong>Technology Stack:</strong>Python, Flask, SQLite3, SQLAlchemy, Jinja, Javascript, Jquery, Ajax, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap
